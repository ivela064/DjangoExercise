Hello dear professor and TA

This is my work for the assignment proposed on the last class Full-Stack Development 
class held on October 11th in which we were told to execute and follow the 
guidelines of the web page geeks for geeks for Django, in total there were 
17 modules, I did all practices, and created some projects through the process
but the one that has the most work it's called 'AnotherProject'.

A lot of these modules had a very confusing code and some codes were not working
appropriately for which I had to search different approaches and solutions 
from other sources. In the end I end up making everything work smoothly as the
geeks for geeks website intended.

I documented every module step by step in my screenshots and also provided
my github repository link for the code.

Thank you very much have a great week.

Ivan Velasco.
