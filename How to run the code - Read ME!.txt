
1. I have provided a requirements.txt file that contains
the necessary modules that are needed to run my code. This file can
be found in the .rar file submitted for the assignment.

2. Open your Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE and open a terminal
Create a new virtual environment on your machine and activate it

3. Once in the environment use: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. After the installation of the requirements has finished successfully 
copy my project folder which is called 'AnotherProject' inside the 
Scripts folder of your newly created virtual environment.

5. Open the project folder with your Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE 
File > Open Folder and select my folder called AnotherProject.

6. Once the project is open another terminal and activate the
virtual environment that you created in your machine.

7. Now you can do everything, use python manage.py runserver to run
the server and check the code URLs and functions. That's it.
